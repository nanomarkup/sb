improvements & bugs
    - NEXT remove the language 
    - move sgo coder to a separate project
    - update documentation
    - use a short name for functions (try it for adapters)
    - check all methods in interfaces
    - fix all external dependencies - github.com/*
    - validate sb code before running the gen command
    - the sb module will be started with sb word
    - the application should be reference to the item, where the following optional items
        - name - optional, default the same as app name  
    - resolve interfaces with different number of methods, typeA can have less number of methods than typeB
          fix "Builder    interface{}" to "Builder    builder" of "SmartBuilder" struct in "app" package

core features
    - add a struct initialization into an item use brackets for overriding global settings, usage: field struct { code }
    - use a "named type" as parameter (at least for interfaces)

smart features
    - add metadata to a struct to describe its functionality (use it for generating apps!)
    - use "application", "feature", and "action" items for describing application requirements
    - "application" - kind of application. It includes a set of features
    - "feature" - application feature. It includes a set of actions
    - "action" - to do a work
    - the smart builder behavior:
        - read smart builder application unit using smodule package?
        - read all smart package units using smodule package?
        - generate smart builder unit according to the requirements and available smart packages
            - create "sapp" package for that
        - build the application

tests
    - list all tests

help
    - .sa - smart application unit. Includes a declarative syntax for describing the application
    - .sb - smart builder unit. It can be generated using .sa unit.
    - .sp - smart package unit. It will be created manually but it should be generated in the future. 
            Describes the exported items. The smart builder will use it for generating .sb unit.
