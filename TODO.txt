improvements & bugs
    - test a global lang parameter
    - update documentation
    - use a short name for functions (try it for adapters)
    - return an error message when getting type information using go.exe
    - check all methods in interfaces
    - broke sb file and fix an error message
    - fix all external dependencies - github.com/*
    - validate sb code before running the gen command
    - add the debug log messages
    - resolve interfaces with different number of methods, typeA can have less number of methods than typeB
