improvements & bugs
    - test a global lang parameter
    - update documentation
    - use a short name for functions (try it for adapters)
    - return an error message when getting type information using go.exe
    - check all methods in interfaces
    - broke sb file and fix an error message
    - fix all external dependencies - github.com/*
    - validate sb code before running the gen command
    - add the debug log messages
    - resolve interfaces with different number of methods, typeA can have less number of methods than typeB
          fix "Builder    interface{}" to "Builder    builder" of "SmartBuilder" struct in "app" package

core features
    - add a struct initialization into an item use brackets for overriding global settings, usage: field struct { code }
    - add a field initialization use a function, usage: field func()
    - add a const item for declaring constants and use them in the module, it is a global item. Usage: const.name
    - provide functions for resolving different types 
    - use numbers as resolver
    - use a "named type" as parameter (at least for interfaces)

smart features
    - add metadata to a struct to describe its functionality (use it for generating apps!)
