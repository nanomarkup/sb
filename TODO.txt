    - resolve interfaces with different number of methods, typeA can have less number of methods than typeB

core features
    - add a struct initialization into an item use brackets for overriding global settings, usage: field struct { code }
    - NEXT: add a define item for declaring defines and use them in the module, it is a special item. Usage: define.name
    - use a "named type" as parameter (at least for interfaces)
